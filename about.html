          As a photographer, my goal is to create images that tell a story and evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Drawing on my background in fine art, I experiment with different techniques to push the boundaries of what is possible and to capture the beauty and complexity of the world around us. Through my work, I hope to inspire others to see the world with new eyes and appreciate the richness of life.

         Studying photography at Cal State University Long Beach deepened my passion for capturing the beauty and complexity of the world. With the guidance of talented faculty and peers, I honed my skills and sought to tell stories that were both personal and universal. After graduation, I pursued my dream of being a freelance photographer, creating images that connected with people on a deep and meaningful level. My work serves as a reminder of the beauty and fragility of life, and I am grateful for the education and support I received at Cal State University Long Beach that helped me build a strong foundation for my career.

         I started my photography Instagram account to share stories through images and connect with other creatives, making it a platform for sharing my work and reflecting my journey as a photographer, as I seek to capture the beauty and complexity of the world and reveal the hidden emotions and realities that often go unseen, and as my account grew, I found inspiration and support from the community that keeps me pushing myself to keep creating (Click Logo).
